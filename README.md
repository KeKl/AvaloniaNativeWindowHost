# PerspexNativeWindowHost
## Desc
Creates a perspex host control for a native window. 
Currently win32 is included as an example and tested. 
Also there is a hack that adds styles and extended styles to the parent window (to the same as wpf uses).
Solution includes wpf comparison project.

## ToDo:
- MeasureOverride: Find an allowed maximum size
- CalculateWindowRect is not properly working
- Tabbing and focus has to be improved
